# lyft_app
use 'npm start' to run the server;

you can test this with curl like so:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/test --data '{"string_to_cut": "iamyourlyftdriver"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
or you can use the testing suite with 'npm test'; it checks a few endpoints and the splitting function. 
Thank you so much for your time and consideration, -Kyle Collins
